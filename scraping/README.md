# Scraping Options for Shadow DOM

This document provides instructions for setting up and running a test environment to explore scraping options for Shadow DOM content. The test involves running a sample HTML application on a local server and executing a Node.js script using Puppeteer to scrape content from the Shadow DOM.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the setup, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. These tools are required to install server dependencies and run the test environment.

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Install the serve Package
First, you need to install the serve package globally using npm. This package allows you to serve static files from any directory through a local server. Open a terminal and run the following command:


```shell
npm install serve -g
```
### 2. Start the Sample HTML Application
Navigate to the project directory where the sample HTML application resides. In the same directory, open a terminal and execute the following command to start the local server:

```shell
serve .
```
This command serves the sample HTML application on a local server. Ensure this server is kept running as you proceed with the next steps.

### 3. Install Project Dependencies
Open a new terminal window (without closing the server from the previous step) and navigate to the project directory again. Install the necessary Node.js dependencies for the project by running:

```shell
npm install
```
This command installs all dependencies listed in the project's package.json file, which includes Puppeteer for web scraping.

### 4. Run the Puppeteer Script
With the dependencies installed and the server running, you can now execute the Puppeteer script to scrape content from the Shadow DOM. Run the following command in the terminal:


```shell
node scraper.js
```

### 5. View Results
After executing the script, you should see the scraped content displayed in the console. This confirms that the setup is successful and the script is able to access and scrape content from the Shadow DOM.

## Enjoy!
You have successfully set up and run a test environment for scraping options with the Shadow DOM. Explore different scraping strategies and Puppeteer functionalities to enhance your scraping tasks.

If you encounter any issues or have questions, consider reviewing Puppeteer's documentation or seeking help from community forums.
